## ANSWER

In type theory, algorithms are often expressed in a functional style using languages that support dependently typed programming, such as Coq, Agda, or Idris. These languages allow us to encode mathematical properties and proofs directly into the type system.

Here is an example of a GCD algorithm using a type-theoretic approach, written in Idris, which is one of the languages designed for dependently typed programming:

```idris
module GCD

-- Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD of two non-negative integers.

-- Define a total function for computing the GCD
gcd : (m, n : Nat) -> Nat
gcd m 0 = m
gcd m n = gcd n (m `mod` n)

-- Here, the `mod` operator returns the remainder of dividing `m` by `n`

-- We can provide a proof that the result is non-negative and is indeed
-- the greatest divisor of both numbers using Idris's dependent types,
-- but for simplicity, here's just the function itself.

-- Example usage:
-- gcd 48 18
-- This should evaluate to 6
```

### Explanation:

- **Type Declaration:** The type of the function `gcd` is `(m, n : Nat) -> Nat`. This signifies that it takes two natural numbers (non-negative integers) and returns a natural number.

- **Base Case:** When `n` is `0`, the GCD is `m`. In the Euclidean algorithm, if one of the numbers is `0`, the GCD is the other number.

- **Recursive Case:** When `n` is not `0`, we call `gcd` recursively with `n` and `m `mod` n` until we reach the base case. This is the essence of the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces the larger number by its remainder when divided by the smaller number.

- **Totality:** In Idris and similar languages, functions must be total, meaning they are defined for all possible inputs and always produce an output. The pattern matching on `0` ensures that the function is total.

In more advanced examples, you could use dependent types to provide machine-checkable proofs of properties such as the returned value truly being the greatest common divisor of the inputs. However, this requires a deeper integration of Idrisâ€™s proof capabilities and is more complex.
