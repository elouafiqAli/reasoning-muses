      "- **Recursive Case:** When `n` is not `0`, we call `gcd` recursively with `n` and `m `mod` n` until we reach the base case. This is the essence of the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces the larger number by its remainder when divided by the smaller number.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Totality:** In Idris and similar languages, functions must be total, meaning they are defined for all possible inputs and always produce an output. The pattern matching on `0` ensures that the function is total.\n",
      "\n",
      "In more advanced examples, you could use dependent types to provide machine-checkable proofs of properties such as the returned value truly being the greatest common divisor of the inputs. However, this requires a deeper integration of Idris’s proof capabilities and is more complex.\n"
