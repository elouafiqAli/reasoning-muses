## ANSWER

Below is a simple illustrative example of how one might define the greatest common divisor (gcd) function in a dependently-typed setting—specifically, using Coq.  In Coq (a proof assistant based on the Calculus of Inductive Constructions), functions must be total and terminating.  The Euclidean algorithm, although terminating in practice, is not obviously so to Coq’s structural recursion checker, so we use a well‐founded recursion (via Program Fixpoint) to convince Coq of termination.

(****************************************************************************
 * We measure the "size" of the problem by (m + n). At each recursive step, *
 * the sum (n + (m mod n)) is strictly smaller than the original (m + n),    *
 * ensuring well-foundedness.                                               *

Program Fixpoint gcd (m n : nat) {measure (m + n)} : nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => m
  | _ => gcd n (m mod n)
  end.

  (* Here we must prove (n + (m mod n)) < (m + n). *)
  (* Using the fact that "m mod n < n", we get (m mod n) + n < n + n <= m + n,  *)
  (* which is sufficient to prove the recursive call is on a smaller measure. *)

Explanation of key points:

1. Totality and termination in type theory:
   In Coq, every function must be terminating.  The usual Euclidean algorithm:
       gcd(m, n) = if n = 0 then m else gcd(n, m mod n)
   needs a justification for termination.  Here, we give Coq a “measure” (m + n) and show it strictly decreases under recursion.

2. Program Fixpoint:
   Program Fixpoint is a Coq feature that allows us to write the function definition in a familiar style, while automatically generating “obligation” subgoals about termination.  We then prove these subgoals, typically using properties of the mod function and natural numbers.

3. Typical gcd properties:
   After defining gcd, one normally proves correctness properties, such as:
   – gcd_divides_left: gcd m n divides m
   – gcd_divides_right: gcd m n divides n
   – gcd_comm: gcd m n = gcd n m
   – gcd_assoc: gcd m (gcd n p) = gcd (gcd m n) p
   – etc.

This demonstrates how one can write (and justify) the gcd algorithm in a dependently-typed setting using Coq. The same ideas apply in other proof assistants (e.g., Agda, Lean) with slight syntactic variations but the same core principle: proving termination and verifying correctness via types (or propositions) rather than just trusting recursion.
