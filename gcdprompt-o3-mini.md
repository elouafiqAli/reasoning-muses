## CHAIN OF THOUGHT

Reasoned about GCD algorithm in type theory pendant 6 secondes
Tracing type theory

I'm curious about writing an algorithm in Coq using type theory constructs, possibly a dependent type for gcd, and thinking about Euclid's algorithm as a starting point.

Implementing gcd

Ok, let me see. I'm aiming to implement the gcd function in Coq with recursion and measure-based termination proof, using the Program module. Progress is steady; the function is shaping up.

Enhancing gcd in Coq

I'm refining the gcd function in Coq with Program for measure-based termination proof. Initially, focusing on recursion until one argument equals zero.

Implementing Euclidean gcd

I’m working through the gcd function in Coq using Euclid’s algorithm with modulo. This method leverages type theory constructs to present a more standardized and thorough implementation.

Crafting Coq-based gcd

I'm piecing together a Coq gcd function using Euclid's algorithm with modulus. This relies on type theory constructs, aiming for a termination proof based on the mod function.

## ANSWER

Below is one way to express the Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor (gcd) in a dependently‐typed setting. For example, here is a Coq version that uses pattern matching on natural numbers and relies on Coq’s built-in support for structural recursion (or you can also use a measure to justify termination):

### Coq Version (Using Modulo)

```coq
Require Import Arith.

(* The Euclidean algorithm using recursion on natural numbers *)
Fixpoint gcd (a b : nat) : nat :=
  match b with
  | 0 => a
  | _ => gcd b (a mod b)
  end.
```

#### Explanation

- **Type Theory Setting:** In Coq, every function must be total and its recursion must be well-founded. Here, the recursive call `gcd b (a mod b)` is guaranteed to terminate because `a mod b` is strictly less than `b` (when `b ≠ 0`), which is a standard result from number theory.
  
- **Pattern Matching:** The function pattern matches on the second argument `b`. When `b` is zero, the algorithm terminates and returns `a` (since the gcd of `a` and 0 is `a`). Otherwise, it recursively calls `gcd` with `b` and `a mod b`.

### An Alternative: Using the Subtraction-Based Algorithm

You can also write Euclid’s algorithm using subtraction. In this version, we compare the two numbers and subtract the smaller from the larger. (Note that you might need to provide a termination proof if the recursion isn’t obviously structural; here we assume the built-in termination checker accepts the recursion because the arguments are decreasing.)

```coq
Require Import Arith.
Require Import Program.

Program Fixpoint gcd_sub (a b : nat) {measure (a + b)} : nat :=
  match a, b with
  | 0, _ => b
  | _, 0 => a
  | _ =>
      if a <? b then gcd_sub a (b - a)
      else gcd_sub (a - b) b
  end.
Next Obligation.
Proof.
  (* When a <? b holds, we need to show that (a + (b - a)) < (a + b). *)
  intros.
  apply Nat.add_lt_mono_r.
  apply Nat.sub_lt; auto with arith.
Qed.
Next Obligation.
Proof.
  (* When a >= b, we need to show that ((a - b) + b) < (a + b). *)
  intros.
  apply Nat.add_lt_mono_l.
  apply Nat.sub_lt; auto with arith.
Qed.
```

#### Explanation

- **Well-Founded Recursion:** In this version, we use the `Program Fixpoint` construct along with a measure `(a + b)` to show that the recursive calls are decreasing. This measure strictly decreases with each recursive call because one of the numbers decreases by at least 1.
- **Branching on Comparison:** The algorithm subtracts the smaller number from the larger one. The `if a <? b then ... else ...` ensures that we choose the proper branch.

### Agda Version

If you prefer to see the algorithm in another dependently typed language like Agda, here’s an equivalent definition:

```agda
open import Data.Nat
open import Data.Nat.DivMod

gcd : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
gcd a 0 = a
gcd a b = gcd b (a mod b)
```

#### Explanation

- **Pattern Matching:** Agda also uses pattern matching on the structure of natural numbers. The base case is when the second argument is zero.
- **Termination:** Agda’s termination checker verifies that the recursive call on `(a mod b)` is on a smaller number (since `a mod b < b`), ensuring that the recursion terminates.

These examples show how the gcd algorithm can be implemented in a type theory setting (using Coq or Agda) where every function must be total and its termination must be justified by the type system.
