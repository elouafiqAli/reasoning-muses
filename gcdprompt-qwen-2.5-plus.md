write gcd algorithm using typetheory

## ANSWER

To write an algorithm for the greatest common divisor (GCD) using type theory, we need to express the computation in a way that aligns with the principles of type theory. Type theory is a formal system where every "term" has a "type," and computations are expressed as functions or constructions over these types.

In this context, we will use **inductive types** and **recursive functions** to define the GCD algorithm. Specifically, we will use the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly applies the property:

\[
\text{gcd}(a, b) = \text{gcd}(b, a \mod b)
\]

until \( b = 0 \), at which point \( \text{gcd}(a, 0) = a \).

### Step-by-Step Construction

1. **Define Natural Numbers**: In type theory, natural numbers (\(\mathbb{N}\)) are typically defined as an inductive type:
   - Zero: \( \text{zero} : \mathbb{N} \)
   - Successor: \( \text{succ}(n) : \mathbb{N} \) for any \( n : \mathbb{N} \)

2. **Define Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation can be defined recursively on natural numbers.

3. **Define GCD Function**: Using the Euclidean algorithm, we define the GCD function recursively.

### Code in Type Theory

Here is how the GCD algorithm might look in a type-theoretic framework like Agda or Coq:

```agda
-- Define the type of natural numbers
data ℕ : Set where
  zero : ℕ
  succ : ℕ → ℕ

-- Define subtraction (for computing modulo)
_−_ : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
zero − _ = zero
(succ m) − zero = succ m
(succ m) − (succ n) = m − n

-- Define modulo operation
_ mod _ : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
m mod zero = m -- Division by zero is undefined; here we return m
zero mod n = zero
(succ m) mod n = if (succ m) < n then (succ m) else ((succ m) − n) mod n

-- Helper function for less-than comparison
_<*_ : ℕ → ℕ → Bool
zero <*_ _ = true
_ <*_ zero = false
(succ m) <*_ (succ n) = m <*_ n

-- Define the GCD function
gcd : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
gcd zero b = b
gcd a zero = a
gcd a b = gcd b (a mod b)
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Natural Numbers (`ℕ`)**:
   - We define natural numbers as an inductive type with two constructors: `zero` and `succ`.

2. **Subtraction (`_−_`)**:
   - Subtraction is defined recursively. If the first number is `zero`, the result is `zero`. Otherwise, we subtract the successor of the second number from the successor of the first.

3. **Modulo Operation (`_ mod _`)**:
   - The modulo operation is defined recursively. If the first number is smaller than the second, it returns the first number. Otherwise, it subtracts the second number and recurses.

4. **Less-Than Comparison (`_<*_`)**:
   - A helper function to check if one natural number is less than another.

5. **GCD Function (`gcd`)**:
   - The GCD function is defined recursively using the Euclidean algorithm:
     - If the first number is `zero`, the result is the second number.
     - If the second number is `zero`, the result is the first number.
     - Otherwise, compute \( \text{gcd}(b, a \mod b) \).

### Example Usage

For example, to compute $\( \text{gcd}(6, 9) \)$:

1. \( \text{gcd}(6, 9) = \text{gcd}(9, 6 \mod 9) = \text{gcd}(9, 6) \)
2. \( \text{gcd}(9, 6) = \text{gcd}(6, 9 \mod 6) = \text{gcd}(6, 3) \)
3. \( \text{gcd}(6, 3) = \text{gcd}(3, 6 \mod 3) = \text{gcd}(3, 0) \)
4. \( \text{gcd}(3, 0) = 3 \)

Thus, \( \text{gcd}(6, 9) = 3 \).

This implementation adheres to the principles of type theory by defining all operations constructively and ensuring that every term has a well-defined type.
